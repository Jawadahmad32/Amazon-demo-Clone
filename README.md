# Amazon-demo-Clone

Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is my first project, an Amazon demo clone, built using basic HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout of Amazonâ€™s homepage, focusing on the structure and styling aspects. This project is a practice exercise to improve my front-end development skills.

Features:
. Basic layout of Amazon homepage.
. Navigation bar, product sections, and footer included.
. Simple styling with CSS.

Note: This is a beginner project and is not yet responsive.

Feel free to explore the code!
